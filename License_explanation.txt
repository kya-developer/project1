This summary is only for understanding. It is not part of the license and is not legally binding. The official KRL text is the only legally valid version.

You can use, copy, change, and share the software for free as long as it’s not for commercial gain.

If you want to use it in anything that makes money, you need to buy a one-time commercial license from the Licensor(s). Selling unmodified copies is never allowed.

Use for AI training and AI projects is fully allowed.

You cannot patent the software or anything based on it; doing so, or breaking major rules, ends your rights under the license immediately.

The software is provided “as-is” with no guarantees. Licensor(s) aren’t responsible for any problems and do not owe support.

Official versions released by the Licensor(s) will always remain open-source.

You may share unmodified copies for free but cannot sell them, and you must not use the software’s name or branding in a way that looks like endorsement.

Any legal disputes follow Netherlands law and must be resolved in the Netherlands.
